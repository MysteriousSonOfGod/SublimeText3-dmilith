Pre-release of version 2.0.0 
============================

15/01/2020

Please Note:
------------

The package is about to be updated to version 2.0.0, which is a major re-factory 
of the whole code.  
You may have noticed that it has already a new name.  
As soon as I tested the package on Windows and Mac (unfortunately I don't have a 
Linux machine), it will be released. 
This probably will take about a week, maybe two, so it is imminent.

Some stuff will be deprecated and some will change.  
I'm trying to make the switch to the new version as painless as possible. 
For example the settings inside a project will be
differently set, so I wrote a command to convert the old settings into the new. 

If you want to know more, please visit the source code and check the 
"command_line_evaluation" branch. If you wish to try already the new version, 
un-install the package (if installed through PackageControl) and clone the git 
repository to your Packages folder, then switch to the "command_line_evaluation" 
branch.  
Be sure to carefully read the new README.md file in that branch to know how 
version 2 is different from version 1 and how it works.
