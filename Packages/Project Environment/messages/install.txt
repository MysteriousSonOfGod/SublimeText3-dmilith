ProjectEnvironment
==================

A plugin for SublimeText 3 that allows to set environment variables in the 
.sublime-project file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables set with Project Environment are available throughout Sublime. 
Builds, scripts, even other plugins can relay and use them.

For example I use it to...

  * set *PYTHONPATH* and have python run successfully scripts that use my custom
    tools, from within Sublime. 
    Anaconda (https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Anaconda) picks up my 
    *PYTHONPATH* too and nicely present code completion on my custom code.
  
  * Set *PATH* to point to some custom tools.

  * Define all the possible custom environment variables that my project needs. 
    (obviously!)

The very nice thing about ProjectEnvironment is that all the variables it 
sets are set per project. ProjectEnvironment can catch when a Sublime's 
project change and re-set the environment variables accordingly. Even more, if 
you have two or more Sublime's windows open at the same time, each time you get 
focus on one of them, Project Environment will run and re-set the variables. 

All this is completely transparent to the user.
