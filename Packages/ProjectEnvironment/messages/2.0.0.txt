New Version 2.0.0
=================

Complete re-factoring of the whole plugin.  
Projects previously set to work with earlier version of this plugin-in, 
MUST be updated.  

Fortunately there is a new command to auto-update old projects. It is active 
only if the Package finds old settings in the Project.

Please consult the documentation at 
https://bitbucket.org/daniele-niero/sublimeprojectenvironment 


Most relevant changes:

  * Name changed from **"Environment Settings"** to **"Project Environment"**

  * It's not longer possible to set variables in the .sublime-settings file.  
    It seemed redundant since that should be a work done before starting  
    Sublime itself.

  * To avoid possible conflicts, project specific settings have now to go  
    inside the "project_environment" entry

  * Beside that, the whole structure of the settings inside the project is  
    changed.

  * A new window command have been added to overcome the above issue and to 
    update old projects: "update_project_environment_settings", labled 
    throughout Sublime as ""Update Project to Version 2.0"
    Active only if old settings are found in the active project.
    Available as all the other commands from Command Palette, Menu and 
    Context Menu

  * Environment command files are no parsed with regular expressions anymore, 
    but executed in a child process through python's subprocess.Popen (with 
    shell=False, so it is safe).
    All the environment variables set in that child process will be used to
    update the main process' variables. 
    This means that these files can execute complex command line scripts to set
    up the environment, something that wasn't possible using regular expressions.
	
  * Output messages have their own output panel.

  * A new window command have been added to clear the output panel: 
  	"clear_project_environment_log".
